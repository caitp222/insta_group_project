## Description
This project was created as part of a group exercise during Phase 3 of Dev Bootcamp. It is a Rails app that uses the React-Rails gem to incorporate a React front-end. It also uses paperclip to upload and save image files, and React and plain Javascript to display the uploaded image directly to the screen.
